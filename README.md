# Features
 Code for used in my final thesis in BSc.
 Visualize the correlation of environmental data and perila disease data.
 Also, predicting perila disease using machine learning methods(Logistic Regression, SVM, RF, LSTM)
 
 
# Requirement
 *Python 3.6.6
 *Keras 2.3.1
 *matplotlib 3.1.2
 *numpy 1.18.0
 *pandas 0.25.3
 *scikit-learn 0.22
 *tensorflow 1.8.0

 
# Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lisashinoda/Final_thesis_BSc.git
cd data_new
```
```bash
python merge_data.py
```
  Merge the separate data as time sequence.
  
```bash
python shift.py
```
  Make the data suitable for machine learning methods.
  (Predict disease using by three days environmental data)

```bash
python filter.py
  Future selection(MethodA)
```

```bash
python corr.py
```
  Emit the environmental data which shows high correlation between other one.
  
```bash
python calculate_p.py
```
  Calculate p-value after calculation of correlation(Method B)
  
```bash
python data_graph.py
```
  Make counter plot graphs.

```bash
python logistic.py
```
  Startã€€Logistic regression and make graphs by logistic regression analysis.

```bash
python svm.py
```
  Start SVM.

```bash
python randomforest.py
```
  Start Random Forest.
  
```bash
python LSTM.py
```
  Start LSTM.
```
 
# Note

Excel files are supposed to create in  the "excel" file.
Visualize graphs(counter plot graphs) are in the "graph" file.
Logistic analysys graphs are in the "logisitic_graph" file.
